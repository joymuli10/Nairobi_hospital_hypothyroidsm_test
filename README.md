# Hypothyroid Prediction
The repository contains models that predict whether a person has hypothyroidism or not. Several models were used after data cleaning 
and exploratory analysis. The models used were Random Forest Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine

# Project Decsription
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.
The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency. The signs are but not limited to
Fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, Constipation, Dry skin, Weight gain, Puffy face, Muscle weakness,Elevated blood cholesterol level
Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness, Pain, stiffness or swelling in your joints and Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter).
 
 Hypothyroidsm is caused by several factors including; autoimmune diseases, Over-response to hyperthyroidism treatment, Thyroid surgery,
 Radiation therapy and Medications. Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you: are a woman, above 60,
 have had hypothyroid surgery among others. Hypothyroidsm does not show over time but once discovered is treatable.
 
 The data set to be used was provided by Nairobi hospital and contains features that are important in knowing whether or not someone might 
 have hypothyroidism. Some of the features are sex, age, tumor, pregnant, surgery among others.
 
 # Technologies Used
 Various Python Libraries.

 # Usage
 This project demonstrates how various regression models can be applied, tested and compared in order to come up with an ideal prediction model.
